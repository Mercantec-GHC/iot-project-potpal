                <h2>🌱 Who We Are</h2>
                <p>We're a group of plant-obsessed university students from the fictional Greenbridge Institute of Technology, majoring in Environmental Engineering and Computer Science. What started as a late-night dorm room chat about why Alex's cactus kept dying turned into a full-blown project. We’re passionate about bridging the gap between nature and tech, and our shared love for greenery (and a little too much caffeine) helped spark the idea for this platform. Now, we're on a mission to make plant care smarter, easier, and more fun.</p>

                <h2>🌍 Why We Built This</h2>
                <p>“Make something that helps the planet.” We immediately thought of plants. Everyone loves plants, but not everyone knows how to keep them alive. We surveyed students and found that over 60% of dorm-room plants died within the first month. Tragic, right?</p>
                <p>That stat hit us hard, so we got to work. Combining affordable sensors, cloud-based data logging, and a sleek dashboard, we created a tool that helps users monitor soil moisture, light levels, temperature, and even reminds you when your plant needs love. What was once a prototype with wires everywhere (and one very confused spider plant) is now a clean, user-friendly web platform that’s growing fast.</p>

                <h2>🚀 Our Vision</h2>
                <p>We believe everyone can be a plant person. Whether you're raising one pothos on your windowsill or managing an entire indoor jungle, our goal is to give you the insights you need to care better. Long term, we want to see our platform used in classrooms, community gardens, urban farms—even space greenhouses someday (hey, dream big).</p>
                <p>This isn’t just a project to us—it’s a movement. We want to make plant care more accessible, especially for young people, students, and busy city dwellers. Because when plants thrive, people do too. And we’re just getting started.</p>
